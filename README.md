# SQL-Final-Project
Class Project using SQL coding


The given instructions for this project were to create a project that is interesting to myself and demonstrates course content. 
It was suggested to look for a business process where the data is stored in Excel, and create a webpage to replace the usage of Excel and stores data in a set of datatables (which represents the prototype for database implementation). The project program requirements is made up of VB.NET procedures inside one or more webpages that use webforms and demonstrates mastery of the content taught in the class modules.
